"Intracksidence"

I want to learn more about probability, statistics, math, and CS, building on what I learned in undergraduate courses in college. 
Up until now I haven't been very committed, so I'm going to use this blog to keep me accountable, posting problems and results from online courses and textbooks. 
This blog is purely for my educational benefit; if you're reading this and you're not me, I hope you also get some educational benefit.
