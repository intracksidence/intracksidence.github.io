<h5>"Intracksidence"</h5>

<p>I want to learn more about probability, statistics, math, and CS, building on what I learned in undergraduate courses in college.</p>
<p>Up until now I haven't been very committed, so I'm going to use this blog to keep me accountable, posting problems and results from online courses and textbooks.</p>
<p>This blog is purely for my educational benefit; if you're reading this and you're not me, I hope you also get some educational benefit.</p>
